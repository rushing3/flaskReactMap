A little web app I decided to make for posting places you've
travelled on a map.

To get started, run these commands from the top directory:

    ```
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

    $ npm install

    $ bower install
    ```

That should install all of your dependencies, it may be useful to do this
using virtualenv.

Then run these commands in seperate terminals:

    ```
    $ gulp

    $ python project/app.py
    ```

Gulp will run and watch for changes as you save them.
